# Middle-Location-Search

A site that searches for a place located in the middle through location of each user. 📍🗺

When people want to choose an appointment place, they want to gather in the middle based on the point where they depart from each other, but it is often not easy to choose an intermediate place. 🤔

In this case, we thought that if we had a site that recommended an intermediate place quickly and easily, we could reduce fatigue in determining an appointment place. 😎

## Screen composition

This project operates on a single page.

There is a map throughout the screen, and reactive sidebars are on both sides.

The user can show or hide the sidebar through the button. 

Rather than providing all the functions to one sidebar, the sidebar is divided into both sides.

It is convenient for a user to use a web page by distinguishing between a portion for inputting information and a portion for receiving information.
